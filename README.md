# Rag-and-Agentic-AI-Projects
Agentic AI and RAG based projects
work with implementing text similarity search using embeddings in Chroma DB, a database system designed for managing and querying text data efficiently.
create a collection and populate the database with a set of sample text documents, where each document is associated with a unique ID and its corresponding embedding generated using the SentenceTransformer embedding function. Subsequently, you will perform a similarity search on a specified query term, retrieving the top three documents that exhibit the highest similarity to the query term

The main objectives included: 

Integrate Chroma DB into applications for storing and querying text data.
Generate text embeddings for text documents using Chroma DB's SentenceTransformer embedding function.
Implement similarity search functionality to compute similarity scores between query embeddings and document embeddings.
Display top-ranked documents similar to a given query term
